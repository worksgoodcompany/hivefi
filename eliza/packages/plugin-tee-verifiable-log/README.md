## Configuration
This plugin depends on plugin-tee.
To get a TEE simulator for local testing, use the following commands:
```shell
docker pull phalanetwork/tappd-simulator:latest
# by default the simulator is available in localhost:8090
docker run --rm -p 8090:8090 phalanetwork/tappd-simulator:latest
```

When using the provider through the runtime environment, ensure the following settings are configured:
```shell
 # Optional, for simulator purposes if testing on mac or windows. Leave empty for Linux x86 machines.
TEE_MODE="LOCAL"                    # LOCAL | DOCKER | PRODUCTION
WALLET_SECRET_SALT= "<your-secret-salt>"            # ONLY define if you want to use TEE Plugin, otherwise it will throw errors

VLOG="true"
```
For detailed configuration of plugin-tee, see the documentation.[docs/docs/advanced/eliza-in-tee.md](/docs/docs/advanced/eliza-in-tee.md)

# AI Workforce Suite (AIWS)

## Overview

The AI Workforce Suite (AIWS) is a comprehensive framework for building and deploying specialized AI agent swarms across various industries and use cases. Each swarm is a collection of purpose-built agents designed to work together to automate and enhance specific domains. HiveFi, our DeFi-focused swarm for Mantle, represents the first implementation of this framework.

## Vision

AIWS aims to revolutionize workforce automation through modular, specialized AI swarms that can operate independently or in concert to handle complex tasks across different sectors. The framework provides the foundation for developing, deploying, and managing these intelligent agent networks.

## Swarm Architecture

## Core Framework

### Multi-Agent Architecture
AIWS provides a flexible foundation for building specialized swarms:

1. Modular Design
   - 18 specialized agents
   - Three agent categories (Internal, Public, Private)
   - Independent agent development
   - Swarm-specific customization
   - Resource sharing

2. Swarm Intelligence
   - Task orchestration via Coordinator Agent
   - Resource optimization
   - Learning capabilities
   - Gas optimization
   - Performance monitoring

3. Integration Framework
   - EVM compatibility
   - Protocol integrations
   - API standardization
   - Data interchange
   - Error handling

### Common Components

1. Base Agent Framework
   - Character system
   - Task management
   - Communication protocols
   - State handling
   - Gas management

2. Swarm Management
   - Deployment tools
   - Monitoring systems
   - Resource allocation
   - Performance tracking
   - Error handling

3. Integration Layer

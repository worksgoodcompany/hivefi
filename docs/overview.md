# HiveFi Overview

## Introduction

HiveFi is a decentralized Multi-Agent System (MAS) designed to enhance DeFi operations on Mantle through intelligent automation and strategic orchestration. Our platform leverages Mantle's Layer 2 scalability and EVM compatibility to provide efficient, cost-effective DeFi automation solutions. For complete technical specifications, see our [technical documentation](specs.md).

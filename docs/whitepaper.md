# HiveFi: Multi-Agent System for Mantle DeFi

## Abstract

HiveFi is a decentralized Multi-Agent System (MAS) designed to enhance DeFi operations on Mantle through intelligent automation and strategic orchestration. For technical implementation details, see our [technical specifications](specs.md).

## Introduction

The DeFi landscape on Mantle presents unique opportunities and challenges that require sophisticated tools for effective participation. HiveFi addresses these needs through a comprehensive suite of AI agents, each specialized in specific aspects of DeFi operations. For a complete list of agents and their capabilities, see our [agents documentation](agents.md).

## System Architecture

### Multi-Agent System

HiveFi employs a modular architecture where specialized agents collaborate to achieve complex DeFi operations. For implementation details, see our [plugin documentation](plugin-starkhive.md).

The system comprises three categories of agents:

2. [Public Agents](agents.md#public-agents-shared-services)
   - Market analytics
   - Trading signals
   - NFT operations
   - Documentation
   - Token deployment

3. [Private Agents](agents.md#private-agents-custom-deployments)
   - Task orchestration
   - DeFi operations
   - Trading execution
   - Security management
   - Treasury operations

### Core Components

1. Action Framework
   - Event-driven architecture
   - Priority-based execution
   - Atomic operations
